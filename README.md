This project contains the two files associated with the capstone project I completed for my Master's in Data Analytics program. 

The scope of the project is relatively narrow. The grading system encouraged students to keep their submissions tightly focused on just one core component of the analysis.

In this case, the project focuses on time series analysis using SARIMA. This does not include other portions of the data analytics process like a data pipeline.
There is not any SQL code is used to extract the data. There are no dashboards or advanced visualizations used due to the constraints of the project and grading system. 

The analysis is conducted on a synthetic dataset that is also available here in the repository.
